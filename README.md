## Repos

Please feel free to check out my various repos and projects:

* [Coding Assignments](https://github.com/mcmullinj84/Ops-Code-Challenges) - Centered around learning coding fundamentals in Bash, Python, and PowerShell and creating automated security tools.

*  Projects - This includes some group projects based around providing secure [networking solutions](https://github.com/405f0und) during an acquisition and creating an [MSP IT Support Plan](https://github.com/Industrial-Software-Solutions-MSP) for fictional businesses. More to come in the future!
